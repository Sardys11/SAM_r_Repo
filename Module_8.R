####### why this?? 
sex <- Student$Sex  # Sex is categorical!!!!!

sex
mean(sex) # This doesn't work.Here is why: In mean.default(sex) : argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

#mean(Sex) will not work unless Sex is encoded numerically. Instead, table(Student$Sex) or summary(Student$Sex) would be better to inspect the category distribution.
#It could be use like this:
# Compute mean grade grouped by Sex

StudentAveragebySex <- ddply(Student_assignment_6, "Sex", summarise, Grade.Average = mean(Grade))

StudentAveragebySex # another way to look at the data

write.csv(i_students, "Data/Filtered_Students.csv", row.names = FALSE) # this command actually creates a csv file. write.csv() automatically sets sep="," (comma separator). And row.names = FALSE ensures that no extra index column is added.

#--STEP 3 Write the filtered data set and convert it to CSV file

# The hint mentions file.choose(), which allows users to interactively select a file location.
# Instead of hardcoding the file path like in Step #2, I might need to modify the write.csv() function to prompt the "user" for a save location:
# Let's try this:

write.csv(i_students, file = file.choose(), row.names = FALSE)
i_students <- subset(students, grepl("i", students$Name, ignore.case = TRUE))

head(i_students)
